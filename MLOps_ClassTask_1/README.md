# MLOps Class Task 1

This repository contains the code and instructions to train and deploy a machine learning model on Vercel using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- GitHub account
- Vercel account

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a new Vercel project and note down the project URL.
4. Generate a Vercel API token and store it as a secret in your GitHub repository.

## Model

Dataset: The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning. It consists of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The goal is to classify the species based on these measurements.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully trained and deployed a machine learning model on Vercel using GitHub Actions. Feel free to explore and customize the code to suit your specific requirements.
